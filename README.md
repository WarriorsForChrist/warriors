</P>
<p>
    This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
npm install<br/>
npm start

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Uses standard git flow with two primary branches: master and develop</li>
    <li>All work initially committed to develop</li>
    <li>Master connected to Heroku for auto-deployment.  I am using the free feature of Heroku to host the website.  I have the “warriors-for-christ.com” domain registered with Google Domains and pointed at Heroku.</li>
    <li>All this means that I can commit and push to “develop” all I want for testing.  Once I merge to “master” it automatically builds and deploys to Heroku.  Basic “Devops”.</li>
    <li>Integrated with Circlci for code analysis.  Each pull request is automatically reviewed.</li>
    <li>Uses W3.css (from w3schools) for responsiveness.  It automatically adjusts spacing and sizes for desktop, tablet, or mobile phone viewing.</li>
</ul>
